            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>
                In this explorer based colonial experience you will be captaining a crew and ship and 
                setting sail. In this game you will be colonizing islands and defending them against 
                other countries.  These other countries will be NPC's.  Hopefully in the future they
                can all be players.  These NPS's will also be trying to colonize and protect islands.
                Along with this they will also be able to customize their ship and they will range in 
                power.  However, they will not be the only ones able to customize and improve their ships.  You,
                the player, will also be able to improve and customize your ship.  This can range from
                a speedy ship to a full blown powerhouse.  The choice is yours.

            <p>
                After your colony finally became big enough they began to send out 
                explorations to other islands and distant lands.  But, so did the 
                other colonies.  Now itâ€™s a race.  Who can find and colonize the best 
                islands first.  More importantly who can defend them the longest.  As 
                a captain in the new colonies fleet you must customize and prepare your 
                ship to engage in exciting battles over the seas.

                This will be a cartoonish solid color game.  There will be sounds 
                played as the player progresses in the game.  Sounds include cannon 
                fire for combat, a victory noise when colonizing an island,  bird 
                noises when closing in on an island, and ambient water noises during 
                exploration.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <h4>How to Play</h4>
            <p>
                In this game the player is sailing to find islands to colonize.  While they
                are doing this they will need to defend their colonies and their own boat in 
                naval combat against the AI.  To win is to score the highest score prior to 
                your boat sinking(due to pirates or other colonies).  You can acquire score
                in three ways: To colonize an island you get 1000 points, to sink another boat 
                you get 100 points, and final you get 1 point for every second you survive.
            </p>
            <h4>Controls</h4>
            <p>
                The controls will be WASD to move the boat.  You then most line up your boat 
                so your cannons are facing the target and then press Q to shoot port side 
                cannons, and then press E to shoot starboard cannons.  There will be a 3 
                second delay in cannon fire so it simulates reloading a cannon.
            </p>
            <h4>How you Learn</h4>
            <p>
                To learn the game a popup will show up before launch to tell you the
                controls.  Besides that it is a pretty straightforward game so the user
                will read the instructions and then just practice and learn on the job.
            </p>
            <h4>What you will need to Learn</h4>
            <p>
                The player will need to learn the fleet sizes of certain colonies and know that 
                pirates tend to have very unique and powerful ships.  On top of all of that the 
                user will need to remember the routes certain ships take and avoid them or ambush 
                them.
