                Captain its time.  We are finally ready to send you out to find new lands to
                colonize and explore!  We can provide you with any ship enhancements you would
                ever want or need!  And trust me you will need them. Also you didn't hear it from 
                me but I heard every other kingdom is also trying to aquire these new lands.  
                So you may need to defend yourself and our new colonies.  Or if it fancies you
                take your enhanced ship and take from other kingdoms.  Just make sure you dont
                sink your ship in the process. We can not bring you back from that.  Best of luck
                captain!
